Scenarios:
1. Bob missed class today so he decided to login to Noté. He logs in, for the first time, using his valid UCSD email. He uses the search bar to find the classes that he had missed, and view the notes posted for that class. He bookmarks the class for later preferences. Bob can see the notes sorted for each lecture and can enlarge them to full screen. There are multiple copies of the same notes uploaded for the same day. Bob can upvote the notes that he found the most helpful. Bob sees a set of notes he does not like, so he flags it. 
2. Bob went to class today and he thinks he took very good notes. He logs into Noté and it remembers his email. After logging in, the app remembers his courses so he can easily navigate to them. He creates a new lecture day and goes to the upload page. He can select from his gallery the pictures he wants to upload. Bob accidentally selects one of his multiple selfies and wants to remove it from the upload queue. He has uploaded more than 3 images and a button pops up to view them in grid view. Bob can see the images he uploaded and can remove the one that he wants to. After uploading the notes, Bob can view the notes he uploaded and can see their ratings.
3. Bob's friend want to use bob's Noté. He logs into it with his email, creating a new profile. He views the notes for his classes and bookmarks them to his own preferences. Bob then wants to use Noté. He logs in using his own email. His old preferences are remembered and his previous courses are still bookmarked. However, Bob's other friend had been using his profile and bookmarked some of his classes. Bob can open up the preferences and remove the classes that he does not need.
